When sourcing content from a headless CMS that provides Markdown/MDX with frontmatter, you need to transform that content into actual HTML at build time. In Gatsby, MDX allows embedding React components in markdown, but the content must be processed through Gatsby’s data pipeline to render properly. The goal is to have Gatsby take the MDX content (including frontmatter and custom JSX tags) and output static HTML pages, just as it would with local MDX files. This involves two main tasks: **sourcing the MDX data as Gatsby nodes** and **transforming those nodes using an MDX pipeline** during the build.

## How Existing Source Plugins Handle MDX Content
Many official and community Gatsby source plugins already solve this problem for popular CMSs. The common pattern is to **provide the CMS’s markdown content as nodes** and then rely on Gatsby’s MDX/Markdown transformers to create HTML or MDX child nodes. Here are a few examples and best practices from existing plugins:

- **Contentful (gatsby-source-contentful):** Contentful can store long text fields as Markdown. The source plugin creates a node for the markdown field and (if MDX is configured) Gatsby will generate a related MDX node. In your GraphQL queries, you’ll see a `childMdx` on that field. For example, querying a Contentful blog post might return `body { childMdx { body } }` ([Processing markdown in Gatsby with Contentful - rogulski.it](https://rogulski.it/blog/gatsby-contentful-markdown-jsx-component/#:~:text=contentfulBlogPost%28slug%3A%20,)). At build time, you can then render the MDX via `<MDXRenderer>` (from `gatsby-plugin-mdx`) to output the HTML. In a Contentful + Gatsby setup, after adding `gatsby-plugin-mdx`, you can query Contentful fields like: 

  ```graphql
  contentfulBlogPost(slug: { eq: $slug }) {
    title
    body {
      childMdx {
        body
      }
    }
  }
  ``` 

  Then in the page template, use Gatsby’s MDX renderer and provider to render that content with React components, e.g.:
  ```jsx
  import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
  import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx";
  
  const BlogPostTemplate = ({ data }) => {
    const { title, body } = data.contentfulBlogPost;
    return (
      <MDXProvider components={shortcodes}>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <article>
          <MDXRenderer>{body.childMdx.body}</MDXRenderer>
        </article>
      </MDXProvider>
    );
  };
  ``` 
  In this setup, the Contentful plugin along with `gatsby-plugin-mdx` automatically transforms the markdown field into an MDX node (exposing `childMdx`) which `MDXRenderer` can render ([Processing markdown in Gatsby with Contentful - rogulski.it](https://rogulski.it/blog/gatsby-contentful-markdown-jsx-component/#:~:text=body%20,)) ([Processing markdown in Gatsby with Contentful - rogulski.it](https://rogulski.it/blog/gatsby-contentful-markdown-jsx-component/#:~:text=return%20%28%20,MDXProvider%3E)). This allows any JSX tags in the Contentful markdown (e.g. `<Star />` components, etc.) to be rendered as React components on the page ([MDX blog posts with Contentful and Gatsby](https://danspratling.dev/blog/mdx-blog-posts-with-contentful#:~:text=import%20,js%2Freact)) ([MDX blog posts with Contentful and Gatsby](https://danspratling.dev/blog/mdx-blog-posts-with-contentful#:~:text=This%20is%20what%20really%20makes,MDXProvider)).

- **Strapi (gatsby-source-strapi):** Newer versions of Strapi have “Rich Text” fields that can be used for markdown/MDX content. The Gatsby source plugin for Strapi v4 sets the appropriate media type on these fields so that Gatsby can treat them as markdown. The result is that simply installing `gatsby-plugin-mdx` will cause those fields to get a `childMdx` automatically in the GraphQL schema ([Parse markdown to mdx? · Issue #89 · gatsby-uc/gatsby-source-strapi · GitHub](https://github.com/strapi/gatsby-source-strapi/issues/89#:~:text=rsaarloos%20%20%20commented%20,80)). In other words, you can query Strapi content like `article.content.childMdx.body` and render it with MDX just as shown above. (Prior to Strapi v4, people achieved this by manually using `onCreateNode` – see below – but now it’s built in.)

- **GraphCMS/Hygraph (gatsby-source-graphcms):** The official GraphCMS plugin provides an option `buildMarkdownNodes: true` to facilitate MDX usage. When enabled, the plugin will create a subordinate Markdown node for each Rich Text field. Each such node has `internal.mediaType = text/markdown`, which triggers the MDX transformer. Consequently, you get a nested `markdownNode { childMdx { ... } }` in your GraphQL schema ([gatsby-source-graphcms | Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-graphcms/#:~:text=Once%20installed%2C%20you%20will%20be,similar%20to%20the%20one%20below)). For example, `allGraphCmsPost { content { markdownNode { childMdx { body } } } }` can be queried, and the `childMdx.body` rendered with `MDXRenderer`. This design (creating a separate markdown node per field) keeps the original data and the transformed content separate.

- **DatoCMS (gatsby-source-datocms):** DatoCMS offers an “MDX” field type. Previously, using `gatsby-plugin-mdx` v3, the Dato source plugin would expose a `postBodyMdxNode.childMdx.body` field similar to the above. However, as of Gatsby 5 and `gatsby-plugin-mdx` v5, that automatic transformation no longer occurs by default ([How to Render mdx content from datocms? -  Support - DatoCMS community](https://community.datocms.com/t/how-to-render-mdx-content-from-datocms/4353#:~:text=But%20now%20after%20upgrading%20the,on%20github%20for%20more%20detail)). (We’ll discuss the Gatsby v5 changes shortly.) In older setups, the approach mirrored Contentful: the plugin created a node for the MDX text and `gatsby-plugin-mdx` turned it into a child MDX node.

**Key takeaways:** The **standard practice** is to mark markdown/MDX content in source nodes such that a **transformer plugin** (like `gatsby-plugin-mdx` or the older `gatsby-transformer-remark`) picks it up. This usually means giving the node or field a known media type and structure so that a `childMdx` (or `childMarkdownRemark`) node is created. By querying that child node’s `body` (and frontmatter), you get the content ready to render. All the heavy lifting of parsing MDX, linking images, etc., is handled by the transformer.

## Setting Up an MDX Transformation Pipeline in Your Plugin
To implement this in your custom source plugin for “LeadCMS” CMS, you should integrate with Gatsby’s MDX pipeline rather than reinventing it. **Gatsby’s official solution is `gatsby-plugin-mdx`**, which uses **Remark** (Markdown parser) and **MDX** under the hood, and can integrate with **Rehype** (HTML processor) plugins as well. Here’s how to set up the pipeline:

1. **Install and configure the necessary packages:** In your Gatsby project (not the source plugin), you’ll need `gatsby-plugin-mdx` plus any remark/rehype plugins you want. Common packages include `@mdx-js/react` (for the MDXProvider), remark plugins like `gatsby-remark-images` or `gatsby-remark-prismjs` for syntax highlighting, etc. For example, to add MDX with syntax highlighting and image support, you might install:
   ```sh
   npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/react gatsby-remark-images gatsby-remark-prismjs
   ``` 
   Then add to `gatsby-config.js`:
   ```js
   // gatsby-config.js
   module.exports = {
     plugins: [
       {
         resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
         options: {
           gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
             { 
               resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`, 
               options: { maxWidth: 800 } 
             },
             { resolve: `gatsby-remark-prismjs` }
           ],
           // You can also specify remarkPlugins or rehypePlugins arrays here
         }
       },
       // ... your source plugin, etc.
     ]
   };
   ``` 
   **Note:** Ensure `gatsby-plugin-mdx` is listed after any source plugins that provide MDX content. Also, Gatsby **requires** `gatsby-source-filesystem` for MDX to work (even for non-file content) – typically you’ll already have it if you use Gatsby v5+ default config, but if not, include a dummy `gatsby-source-filesystem` pointed at some path to satisfy the dependency ([gatsby-mdx-remote | Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-mdx-remote/#:~:text=resolve%3A%20%60gatsby,images%60%2C%20options%3A)) ([gatsby-mdx-remote | Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-mdx-remote/#:~:text=maxWidth%3A%201200%2C%20,)).

2. **Create nodes with the MDX content in your source plugin:** In your plugin’s `sourceNodes` API, fetch the data from the CMS (which presumably gives you an MDX string with frontmatter). For each item, create a Gatsby node and **attach the MDX text to it**. There are two ways to do this:
   
   - **Directly on the source node:** You can put the MDX (including frontmatter) into the node’s `internal.content` and mark its `internal.mediaType` as a markdown MIME type. For example:  
     ```js
     // Inside sourceNodes
     const { createNode, createNodeId, createContentDigest } = actions;
     data.forEach(item => {
       const mdxContent = item.mdx; // the raw MDX string (with frontmatter)
       createNode({
         id: createNodeId(`leadcms-${item.id}`),
         parent: null,
         children: [],
         internal: {
           type: "LeadCMSEntry",  // your node type
           mediaType: "text/markdown", // treat as markdown/MDX content
           content: mdxContent,
           contentDigest: createContentDigest(mdxContent)
         },
         // You can also copy frontmatter fields to the node for easy access:
         title: item.title,
         date: item.date,
         // ... other frontmatter fields if available
       });
     });
     ```
     Setting `internal.mediaType` to `text/markdown` (or `text/x-markdown`) is **critical** – it flags to Gatsby’s transformer that this node contains markdown content ([gatsby-plugin-mdx: Remote markdown body fetched before Mdx processes node content · Issue #23281 · gatsbyjs/gatsby · GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/23281#:~:text=You%27ll%20want%20to%20use%20createRemoteFileNode,sources)). Gatsby’s data layer will then let `gatsby-plugin-mdx` process this node.

   - **Using a child “markdown” node:** Alternatively, create a separate child node solely for the MDX content. This is the pattern used by GraphCMS and others. For example, after creating the parent node (with its fields but without the full content), do:  
     ```js
     const parentNodeId = createNodeId(`leadcms-${item.id}`);
     createNode({
       id: parentNodeId,
       parent: null,
       children: [],
       internal: {
         type: "LeadCMSEntry",
         contentDigest: createContentDigest(item),
       },
       title: item.title,
       date: item.date,
       // ...other metadata fields
     });
     // Now create a child node for the MDX text
     const mdxContent = item.mdx;
     const childNodeId = createNodeId(`leadcms-mdx-${item.id}`);
     createNode({
       id: childNodeId,
       parent: parentNodeId,
       children: [],
       internal: {
         type: "LeadCMSEntryMarkdown", // or some type name for the raw content
         mediaType: "text/markdown",
         content: mdxContent,
         contentDigest: createContentDigest(mdxContent)
       }
     });
     createParentChildLink({ parent: getNode(parentNodeId), child: getNode(childNodeId) });
     ``` 
     This will result in your `LeadCMSEntry` node having a child of type `LeadCMSEntryMarkdown`. Gatsby’s MDX plugin will detect the child with mediaType markdown and transform it into an **Mdx** node (of type `Mdx`) as a *grandchild*. The net effect in GraphQL is similar: `LeadCMSEntry` will get a `childMdx` field due to the transformer.

   Both approaches can work. The **simpler** route is marking the main node with the MDX content (first approach). Indeed, in Gatsby MDX v3 and earlier, any node with `mediaType: text/markdown` would get a `childMdx` automatically ([MDX v2 · gatsbyjs gatsby · Discussion #25068 - GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/25068#:~:text=Any%20nodes%20that%20have%20media,with%20V3%20causing%20quite)). 

3. **Let `gatsby-plugin-mdx` do the transformation:** With the above in place, when you run `gatsby build` (or develop), Gatsby will pass those nodes into the MDX transformer. The MDX plugin will parse the frontmatter and MDX body. It will **create a new node of type `Mdx`** (this is the unified Mdx node type used for all MDX content) as a child of your source node. You don’t have to manually create the Mdx nodes – the plugin handles it internally via Gatsby’s transformer API. As the MDX nodes are created, Gatsby will *augment* the GraphQL schema: your source node type will now have a field like `childMdx` (or in the child-node approach, the child gets `childMdx`). For example, after the build starts you should see in GraphiQL that an `LeadCMSEntry` has `childMdx.frontmatter` and `childMdx.body` available to query, just like the Contentful example above.

4. **GraphQL Schema considerations:** If your MDX content’s frontmatter has specific fields (like `title`, `tags`, etc.) that you want to query or filter on, you might want to define those in Gatsby’s schema. Gatsby will infer frontmatter fields from the content if possible, but with remote MDX it’s sometimes tricky. A good practice is to use `createSchemaCustomization` in your plugin to explicitly define types. For instance: 
   ```js
   exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
     const { createTypes } = actions;
     createTypes(`
       type LeadCMSEntry implements Node {
         title: String
         date: Date @dateformat
         # ... other fields ...
         childMdx: Mdx @link
       }
       type Mdx implements Node { frontmatter: MdxFrontmatter }
       type MdxFrontmatter {
         title: String
         date: Date @dateformat
         # ... define expected frontmatter fields for MDX if needed
       }
     `);
   };
   ```
   This ensures that GraphQL knows the shape of your data (especially important if no local `.mdx` files exist for inference). Some community plugins even recommend including at least one dummy MDX file in `src/pages` to help bootstrap the Mdx schema ([gatsby-mdx-remote | Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-mdx-remote/#:~:text=To%20get%20started%20with%20this,local%20MDX%20file%20must%20exist)), but explicit type definitions are a cleaner solution in a source plugin.

5. **Render the MDX content in pages:** With the GraphQL data layer set up, using the content is straightforward. In your page templates or React components, query for the MDX nodes. Typically you’d query your source nodes and pull in the transformed MDX body. For example: 
   ```graphql
   query LeadCMSPage($id: String!) {
     onlineSalesEntry(id: {eq: $id}) {
       title
       childMdx {
         frontmatter { title /* etc */ }
         body
       }
     }
   }
   ``` 
   Then in the page component, use the **MDXRenderer** to output the content. Make sure to wrap it in an **MDXProvider** if you have custom components/shortcodes. For example:
   ```jsx
   import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
   import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx";
   import * as Shortcodes from "../components/MDXShortcodes"; // import your custom components
   
   const LeadCMSPage = ({ data }) => {
     const post = data.onlineSalesEntry;
     return (
       <MDXProvider components={Shortcodes}>
         <h1>{post.title}</h1>
         <MDXRenderer>{post.childMdx.body}</MDXRenderer>
       </MDXProvider>
     );
   };
   ```
   The `MDXRenderer` component will take the compiled MDX content (from the GraphQL query) and render it to React elements (which become static HTML during build). The `MDXProvider` makes sure any custom React tags in the MDX (like `<Button>` or `<Chart>`) are resolved to your actual components. You can pass a mapping of component names to components via the `components` prop of MDXProvider. For example, if your MDX content uses `<MyWidget />`, ensure you import `MyWidget` and include it in the `components` map (e.g. `components={{ MyWidget }}`). Gatsby’s MDX docs refer to these as “shortcodes” or components for MDX ([MDX blog posts with Contentful and Gatsby](https://danspratling.dev/blog/mdx-blog-posts-with-contentful#:~:text=import%20,we%27ll%20need%20in%20our%20markdown)) ([MDX blog posts with Contentful and Gatsby](https://danspratling.dev/blog/mdx-blog-posts-with-contentful#:~:text=This%20is%20what%20really%20makes,MDXProvider)). This technique was used in the Contentful MDX example to provide a `Star` component for the `<Star>` tag in markdown ([MDX blog posts with Contentful and Gatsby](https://danspratling.dev/blog/mdx-blog-posts-with-contentful#:~:text=import%20,we%27ll%20need%20in%20our%20markdown)).

6. **(Optional) Use remark/rehype plugins for advanced transforms:** Gatsby MDX supports the remark/rehype plugin ecosystem. This means you can add plugins to handle things like embedding images, auto-linking headers, etc., just as you would with markdown. In the config snippet above, we included `gatsby-remark-images` which processes image paths in MDX and transforms them into optimized `<img>`. There are many remark plugins (for example, `remark-slug`, `remark-autolink-headings`, `remark-abbr`, etc.) and rehype plugins (for HTML AST transformations) that you can configure under `options.remarkPlugins` and `options.rehypePlugins` for `gatsby-plugin-mdx`. For instance:
   ```js
   // gatsby-config.js (within gatsby-plugin-mdx options)
   remarkPlugins: [ require('remark-slug'), require('remark-external-links') ],
   rehypePlugins: [ require('rehype-highlight') ],
   ```
   These would add IDs to headings and syntax highlight code blocks, respectively. **Important:** If your MDX content includes images from remote URLs (e.g. images hosted in the CMS), the standard `gatsby-remark-images` might not handle them. In such cases, look for CMS-specific remark plugins (Contentful had a `gatsby-remark-images-contentful` ([Processing markdown in Gatsby with Contentful - rogulski.it](https://rogulski.it/blog/gatsby-contentful-markdown-jsx-component/#:~:text=options%3A%20,lazy)) ([Processing markdown in Gatsby with Contentful - rogulski.it](https://rogulski.it/blog/gatsby-contentful-markdown-jsx-component/#:~:text=%7B%20resolve%3A%20%60gatsby,%7D%2C)), and there are similar plugins or workarounds for other sources), or consider writing a custom remark plugin to handle remote images. You can also disable image processing and just render `<img>` tags directly if needed.

## Gatsby v5 and MDX v2 Considerations 
It’s worth noting a recent change: **Gatsby v4/v5 with `gatsby-plugin-mdx@v4+` (which uses MDX v2)** no longer automatically processes arbitrary nodes with `mediaType: text/markdown` unless they originate from the filesystem. The team temporarily focused on filesystem-based MDX for the new version, meaning the pattern that worked in Gatsby v3 (using `childMdx` on remote data) might not work out-of-the-box in newer versions ([How to Render mdx content from datocms? -  Support - DatoCMS community](https://community.datocms.com/t/how-to-render-mdx-content-from-datocms/4353#:~:text=But%20now%20after%20upgrading%20the,on%20github%20for%20more%20detail)). If you find that after following the steps above, your `childMdx` fields aren’t appearing or MDX content isn’t transforming in Gatsby 5, you have a couple of options:

- **Use the `gatsby-mdx-remote` plugin:** This is a community plugin designed to bridge the gap for remote MDX content. It essentially automates the process of creating intermediate `.mdx` files in Gatsby’s cache from your remote content, so that the standard MDX transformer will pick them up ([gatsby-mdx-remote | Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-mdx-remote/#:~:text=extracts%20an%20mdx%20string%20from,as%20any%20other%20MDX%20content)). The plugin watches specified node types and fields (configurable via options like `mdxNodeTypes` and `mdxField`) and in its `onCreateNode` it will take your node’s MDX string and write out a temp file with frontmatter, then create a File node and link it. This triggers `gatsby-plugin-mdx` as if a real MDX file existed. The **gatsby-mdx-remote README** outlines this process: *“Once an MDX string with YAML frontmatter have been concatenated together, it is written as a File node with the .mdx extension into the Gatsby cache. The gatsby-plugin-mdx plugin picks up the MDX file object as usual and transforms it into an Mdx node.”* ([gatsby-mdx-remote | Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-mdx-remote/#:~:text=3,as%20any%20other%20MDX%20content)). In practice, to use it, you’d add `gatsby-mdx-remote` *alongside* `gatsby-plugin-mdx` in your `gatsby-config`, and configure it to target your source plugin’s node type and MDX field. This approach has been successfully used for DatoCMS and others when upgrading to Gatsby 5 ([How to Render mdx content from datocms? -  Support - DatoCMS community](https://community.datocms.com/t/how-to-render-mdx-content-from-datocms/4353#:~:text=m,7%3A38am%20%202)). It saves you from writing the file-handling logic yourself.

- **Fallback to an older MDX transformer or custom compile:** If for some reason you cannot use `gatsby-mdx-remote`, another approach is to stick with `gatsby-plugin-mdx@3.x` (the Gatsby v3 era plugin) which still honors remote nodes with `mediaType: text/markdown`. This is not generally recommended (as it means using older Gatsby plugin versions), but it’s a quick fix if upgrading isn’t an option. Otherwise, a fully custom solution would involve using the lower-level MDX libraries (`@mdx-js/mdx`) in your plugin or `gatsby-node` to compile MDX to React and HTML. However, doing so manually means you’d lose out on Gatsby’s automatic image optimization, linking, and the integration with Gatsby’s GraphQL (making it harder to query frontmatter, etc.). Thus, using the plugin chain (possibly with `gatsby-mdx-remote`) is the **best practice**.

## Structuring the Plugin for Smooth Integration
To ensure your source plugin plays nicely with Gatsby’s data layer, follow these structural tips:

- **Node Types and Naming:** Use distinct `internal.type` names for your nodes (e.g. `LeadCMSEntry` and perhaps a child type like `LeadCMSEntryMarkdown` as shown). This prevents conflicts and makes GraphQL schema clear. If you use a child node for MDX content, it’s helpful to give it a type name that implies its purpose (like “…Markdown” or “…MdxContent”).

- **GraphQL Schema Setup:** As mentioned, implement `createSchemaCustomization` to define your node’s fields (especially if you want to expose frontmatter as first-class fields). Gatsby will automatically add `childMdx: Mdx` relationships for you when the transformer runs, but defining your types can avoid warnings about inferred types. For example, you might declare that your `LeadCMSEntry` has fields corresponding to the frontmatter (title, slug, etc.), plus a `body` or `rawContent` field of type `String` (if you want the raw MDX string accessible) and perhaps a `childMdx` field of type `Mdx`. By using the `@link` directive as shown above, you hint that `childMdx` will link to the MDX node Gatsby creates.

- **Implement `sourceNodes` (or `onCreateNode`) carefully:** It’s often simplest to fetch all your CMS data in `sourceNodes` and create the nodes there. Ensure you call `createContentDigest` on **the content** (not just the item object) so that Gatsby can cache and not re-create nodes unnecessarily. If your CMS has large content, consider using `cache` API to store raw results between builds. Also, if your plugin needs to update nodes when content changes, make sure to give stable IDs (using `createNodeId` with a unique prefix + CMS ID as shown, so the same CMS entry maps to the same node ID across runs).

- **Leverage `onCreateNode` if needed for transformation:** An alternate design is to first create basic nodes for your CMS data (without MDX processing), and then use Gatsby’s `onCreateNode` API within your plugin to intercept those nodes and generate the child MDX nodes. This pattern might look like:
  ```js
  exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions }) => {
    if(node.internal.type === "LeadCMSEntry" && node.mdxContent) {
      // create child with mediaType text/markdown
      // (similar to the childNode example above)
    }
  }
  ```
  However, since you control the source plugin, doing it all in `sourceNodes` (as earlier) is fine. Just be sure not to double-create nodes.

- **Page Creation:** Finally, tie it into page creation. If each MDX entry should become a page, use `createPages` in your site’s `gatsby-node.js` (or the File System Route API in Gatsby v4+). For example:
  ```js
  exports.createPages = async ({ actions, graphql }) => {
    const { createPage } = actions;
    const result = await graphql(`
      {
        allLeadCMSEntry {
          nodes { id, slug }
        }
      }
    `);
    result.data.allLeadCMSEntry.nodes.forEach(node => {
      createPage({
        path: `/posts/${node.slug}/`,
        component: require.resolve(`./src/templates/onlineSalesPage.js`),
        context: { id: node.id }
      });
    });
  };
  ```
  This will generate pages for each entry, and in `onlineSalesPage.js` you would use the GraphQL query and MDXRenderer as described. (If you prefer file system routing, you could name your template file `src/pages/onlineSales/{LeadCMSEntry.slug}.js` and Gatsby will automatically create pages for each node of that type.)

By following these practices, your custom source plugin will integrate smoothly. It essentially will act much like the Contentful or GraphCMS plugins – feeding MDX content into Gatsby and letting Gatsby’s transformer do the work. You get to use Markdown/MDX in your CMS and have it render as full React pages, complete with any interactive components.
