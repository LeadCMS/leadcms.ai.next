# Plugins

LeadCMS uses a modular plugin architecture that allows extending functionality through specialized components. Each plugin can provide additional API endpoints, background tasks, external service integrations, and custom application features.

## Plugin Architecture Overview

LeadCMS plugins are dynamically loaded modules that extend the core functionality of the system. Each plugin can provide:

- **Additional API endpoints and services** - Extend the REST API with custom functionality
- **Background tasks and scheduled jobs** - Automated processing and data synchronization
- **Integration with external services** - Connect with third-party APIs and services
- **Custom middleware and application features** - Add specialized business logic

Plugins are configured through environment variables and settings files, allowing for flexible deployment configurations.

## Available Plugins

LeadCMS provides several powerful plugins to extend functionality. Each plugin is designed to integrate seamlessly with the core system and can be configured independently.
