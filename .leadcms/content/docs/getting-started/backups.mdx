# Backups and Recovery

This guide covers how to backup and restore your LeadCMS data using both local and remote backup strategies. We provide automated scripts to simplify the process and ensure data safety.

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical: Regular Backups">
  Regular backups are essential for protecting your content and configuration. Implement automated backup procedures and test restore processes regularly.
</Callout>

## Understanding LeadCMS Backups

### What to Backup

LeadCMS backups should include:

* **PostgreSQL Database**: All content, users, and configuration data
* **Environment Configuration**: `.env` file with all settings
* **Docker Configuration**: `docker-compose.yml` file
* **Custom Plugins**: Any custom plugins you've developed or modified

### Backup Types

**Full Backup**: Complete database backup including all tables and data. Recommended for regular backups and before upgrades.

**Selective Backup**: Database backup excluding user-related tables (users, roles, permissions). Useful for development or when migrating content between environments.

**Media-Only Backup**: Backup only media files table. Useful for quickly restoring just uploaded assets.

## Local Backup and Restore

### Prerequisites

The backup scripts are included in the LeadCMS deploy repository. Ensure you have them available:

```bash
# If you haven't already cloned the deploy repository
git clone https://github.com/LeadCMS/leadcms.deploy.git
cd leadcms.deploy

# The repository includes these backup scripts:
# - pg-backup.sh
# - pg-restore.sh
# - pg-restore-media.sh

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x pg-backup.sh pg-restore.sh pg-restore-media.sh

# Ensure .env file exists with database credentials
ls -la .env
```

### Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should contain the database connection details:

```bash
# Required for backup scripts
POSTGRES__USERNAME=leadcms_user
POSTGRES__PASSWORD=your_password
# Database host is assumed to be localhost:5432
```

### Full Database Backup

Create a complete backup of your LeadCMS database:

```bash
# Create full backup with all tables
./pg-backup.sh leadcms

# This creates a file named: leadcms-backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.sql
```

Verify the backup was created:

```bash
# Check backup file was created
ls -lh leadcms-backup-*.sql

# Verify backup contents (should show database structure)
file leadcms-backup-*.sql
```

### Selective Backup (Excluding User Data)

For development or content migration, exclude user-related tables:

```bash
# Backup without user tables, roles, and settings
./pg-backup.sh leadcms --exclude-user-tables

# This excludes:
# - users
# - user_claims
# - user_logins
# - user_roles
# - user_tokens
# - setting
# - roles
# - role_claims
```

<Callout type="info" title="Use Case for Selective Backups">
  Selective backups are ideal when you want to migrate content from production to development environments without copying user accounts and permissions.
</Callout>

### Restoring from Backup

#### Full Database Restore

```bash
# Stop only the LeadCMS application to avoid conflicts (keep PostgreSQL running)
docker compose stop leadcms

# Restore from backup file
./pg-restore.sh leadcms leadcms-backup-2024-09-08-14-30.sql

# The script will:
# - Create database if it doesn't exist
# - Drop existing tables and data
# - Restore all data from backup

# Start the LeadCMS service
docker compose start leadcms

# Verify restoration
docker compose logs leadcms | grep -i "started successfully"
```

#### Media-Only Restore

To restore just media files (uploaded assets):

```bash
# Restore only media table from backup
./pg-restore-media.sh leadcms leadcms-backup-2024-09-08-14-30.sql

# This restores only the media table, preserving other data
```
