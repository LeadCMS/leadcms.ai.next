# LeadCMS Documentation

Welcome to the LeadCMS documentation!

## What is LeadCMS?

LeadCMS is a free, open source headless CMS & CRM platform for modern developers. You use it to manage content with AI assistance, track customer journeys, and automate lead generation. LeadCMS provides headless CMS capabilities perfect for Next.js, Gatsby, and any modern framework, plus comprehensive CRM features for complete customer management.

It automatically handles complex backend operations like content versioning, customer tracking, and plugin orchestration. You can focus on building great websites and growing your business.

Whether you're an individual developer, agency, startup, or enterprise team, LeadCMS gives you a free, open source alternative to expensive proprietary CMS platforms.

## CMS and CRM in one platform

LeadCMS uniquely combines two powerful systems:

- **Free Open Source Headless CMS**: Modern content management system with AI-powered automation. Perfect for building lightning-fast websites with Next.js, Gatsby, Astro, or any framework you prefer.
- **Integrated CRM**: Customer relationship management with analytics and insights for tracking the entire customer journey from first visit to conversion.

This integrated approach means you can manage both content and customers in one platform, with shared data and unified workflows.

## How to use the docs

The docs are organized into 2 main sections:

- **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)**: Step-by-step tutorials to help you deploy LeadCMS and learn the core features.
- **[Plugins](/docs/plugins)**: Comprehensive guide to available plugins and how to extend functionality.

## Architecture Overview

LeadCMS uses a modern, enterprise-grade technology stack:

- **Backend**: Built on .NET and C# for high performance and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage with JSON support and full-text search.
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for consistent deployment across environments.

This architecture ensures scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

Our documentation assumes some familiarity with modern web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:

- **Docker** and containerization concepts
- **REST APIs** and HTTP requests
- **Git** for version control
- **Command line** basics

If you're planning to extend LeadCMS with custom plugins, knowledge of **C#** and **.NET** will be helpful.
