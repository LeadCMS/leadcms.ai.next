# Getting Started

Welcome to LeadCMS! This guide will help you set up your first project and start building amazing websites in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18+** - [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm or yarn** - Package manager (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** - Version control system

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Check">
You can verify your installations by running:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```
</Callout>

## Step 1: Create Your Account

First, you'll need to create a LeadCMS account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Visit [leadcms.io/signup](https://leadcms.io/signup) and create your free account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Email">
    Check your email and click the verification link to activate your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your First Project">
    Once logged in, click "New Project" to create your first LeadCMS project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Install LeadCMS CLI

The LeadCMS CLI makes it easy to manage your projects from the command line:

```bash
npm install -g @leadcms/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
leadcms --version
```

## Step 3: Initialize Your Project

Now let's create your first LeadCMS project:

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir my-leadcms-site
cd my-leadcms-site

# Initialize LeadCMS
leadcms init
```

The CLI will prompt you for:
- Project name
- Template (choose from various starters)
- Deployment preferences

<Callout type="info" title="Templates Available">
LeadCMS offers several starter templates:
- **Blog** - Perfect for blogs and content sites
- **Business** - Marketing and business websites
- **E-commerce** - Online stores and product catalogs
- **Documentation** - Technical documentation sites
- **Portfolio** - Personal and agency portfolios
</Callout>

## Step 4: Configure Your Environment

After initialization, you'll have a `.env.local` file with your project configuration:

```bash
# .env.local
LEADCMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LEADCMS_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
LEADCMS_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Keep Your Keys Safe">
Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Start Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The development server includes:

- **Hot reloading** - Changes appear instantly
- **Content preview** - See unpublished content
- **Error reporting** - Detailed error messages
- **Performance monitoring** - Built-in performance insights

## Step 6: Create Your First Content

Let's create your first piece of content:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open LeadCMS Admin">
    Visit your project's admin URL (provided during setup) and log in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Page">
    Click "New Page" and fill in:
    - Title: "Welcome to My Site"
    - Slug: "welcome"
    - Content: Add some text using the rich editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Click "Publish" to make your content live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 7: Fetch Content in Your Site

Now let's display this content in your frontend:

```typescript
// pages/welcome.tsx
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next'
import { LeadCMS } from '@leadcms/client'

interface WelcomePageProps {
  page: {
    title: string
    content: string
  }
}

export default function WelcomePage({ page }: WelcomePageProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{page.title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: page.content }} />
    </div>
  )
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const cms = new LeadCMS({
    apiKey: process.env.LEADCMS_API_KEY!,
    projectId: process.env.LEADCMS_PROJECT_ID!
  })

  const page = await cms.pages.getBySlug('welcome')

  return {
    props: {
      page
    },
    revalidate: 60 // Revalidate every minute
  }
}
```
