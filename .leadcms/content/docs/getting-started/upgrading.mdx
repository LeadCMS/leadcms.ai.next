# Upgrading LeadCMS

This guide covers how to safely upgrade your LeadCMS Docker Compose installation to the latest version, including backup procedures, database migrations, and rollback strategies.

<Callout type="info" title="Docker Compose Focus">
  This guide is specifically for Docker Compose deployments as covered in our [deployment guide](/docs/getting-started/deploying). For production environments with managed services, adapt these procedures to your infrastructure.
</Callout>

## Before You Upgrade

### Check Current Version

```bash
# Or check via API
curl http://localhost:8080/api/version
```

### Review Release Notes

Always review the release notes before upgrading:

* Check [Core Releases](https://github.com/LeadCMS/leadcms.core/releases) for application changes
* Check for breaking changes
* Note any new configuration requirements
* Review plugin compatibility

### Backup Your System

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical: Create Backups">
  Always create complete backups before upgrading. Use the provided backup scripts for reliable backup and restore procedures.
</Callout>

We recommend using the automated backup scripts covered in detail in our [Backups and Recovery guide](/docs/getting-started/backups).

#### Quick Backup with Scripts

```bash
# Full backup using the pg-backup.sh script
./pg-backup.sh leadcms

# This creates: leadcms-backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.sql
# Verify backup was created successfully
ls -lh leadcms-backup-*.sql
```

#### Configuration Backup

```bash
# Backup essential configuration files
cp .env .env.backup
cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.backup

# If you have custom plugins mounted via volumes
cp -r plugins/ plugins_backup/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No custom plugins directory found"
```

## Upgrade Process

This is the simplest method for upgrading when using the standard LeadCMS Docker images:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Current Services">
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your docker-compose directory
    cd /path/to/your/leadcms/docker-compose

    # Stop all services
    docker compose down
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Image Version">
    Edit your `docker-compose.yml` to use the new version:

    ```yaml
    services:
      leadcms:
        image: leadcms/core:v2.1.0  # Update to desired version
        # ... rest of your configuration
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull New Image">
    ```bash
    # Pull the new image
    docker compose pull leadcms
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Services">
    ```bash
    # Start services with new image
    docker compose up -d
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Database Migrations

LeadCMS automatically runs database migrations when the container starts. You can monitor this process:

## Best Practices

### Upgrade Strategy

1. **Test in staging** before production
2. **Schedule maintenance windows** for upgrades
3. **Monitor closely** after upgrades
4. **Have rollback plan** ready
5. **Document changes** for your team
