<FAQSection title="Frequently Asked Questions" description="Everything you need to know about our website cost estimates">
  <FAQItem question="What's included in the estimate?">
    The estimate covers our consulting and development services: discovery, design, implementation, integrations, content support, and deployment setup. It includes the website type base cost, design approach, features, integrations, content writing, and your chosen deployment option. LeadCMS itself is free and open source - the calculator does not charge for the platform.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem question="Can I customize the estimate further?">
    Absolutely! The calculator gives you a solid starting point based on common configurations. If you have specific requirements - such as custom integrations, advanced workflows, or unique design needs - contact us to get a detailed proposal tailored to your project.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem question="Is LeadCMS really free?">
    Yes! LeadCMS is 100% open source and free to use under the MIT license. The costs in our calculator cover professional development, design, content creation, and optional managed services - not the platform itself.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem question="What if I want to build it myself?">
    DIY is absolutely fine. LeadCMS is free, so the only cost is your time and internal resources. Use the calculator if you want our team to help - it estimates the services required to deliver the same outcome for you.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem question="How accurate is the estimate?">
    The calculator provides a reliable ballpark based on typical project scopes. Please note that this estimate is for informational purposes only - it is not a binding quote, public offer, or contractual commitment. Final pricing may vary depending on complexity, timeline, and specific requirements discovered during detailed project analysis. Think of it as a transparent starting point for your budget planning.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem question="What deployment option should I choose?">
    Cloud (Managed) is best if you want hassle-free hosting with automatic updates and maintenance. On-Premises (DIY) is perfect if you have your own infrastructure and prefer full control at zero deployment cost. On-Premises (Managed) gives you the best of both worlds - your infrastructure, our expertise.
