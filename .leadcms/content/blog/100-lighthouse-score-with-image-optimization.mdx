A fast website is usually won or lost in one place: **images**. Oversized files, wrong formats, and inconsistent dimensions can tank your Lighthouse score even if your code is perfect.

**LeadCMS** solves this at the source. With the new Media Library features and built-in image optimisation, you can upload images once and let the platform automatically produce web-ready assets that load quickly, stay sharp, and keep your pages consistently performant.

In this article, we'll cover the practical setup and day-to-day workflow that helps teams reliably build **very fast websites** and aim for **100% Lighthouse** performance scores - maybe not exactly 100%, but close:

## Why Images Are the #1 Performance Lever

Most pages are image-heavy: hero banners, product shots, blog covers, screenshots, logos, thumbnails. If those images are too large, your visitors pay the price with:

- Slower Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Higher bandwidth usage (especially on mobile)
- Lower performance scores and worse UX

LeadCMS tackles these problems by making image optimisation part of your normal publishing workflow - not a separate tool chain you have to remember.

## Step 1: Turn On Media Optimisation (The “Set It and Forget It” Win)

LeadCMS can automatically optimise images as they are uploaded. This includes:

- Converting images into modern formats like **AVIF** (or WebP/JPEG/PNG)
- Resizing oversized images to a maximum dimension you control
- Reducing file sizes while keeping good quality
- Preserving transparency where supported (important for UI assets)

This is configured in the **Settings** panel.

![Media optimisation settings in LeadCMS](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/leadcms-media-settings.avif)

Settings now include:

- **File Management**: maximum file size for uploads (KB)
- **Optimisation Settings**:
  - Auto-Optimise on Upload (manual optimisation in Media Preview is always available)
  - Maximum Dimensions (width/height)
  - Format & Quality (target format like AVIF and quality %)
- **Cover Image Settings**:
  - Auto-resize cover images
  - Cover dimensions (used for both AI generation and automatic resizing)

A solid default for most sites is:

- Enable Media Optimisation: **On**
- Preferred Format: **AVIF** (best compression)
- Maximum Dimensions: something reasonable like **1024×1024** (or smaller if your design never needs bigger)

<Callout type="info">
  Why this matters for Lighthouse: smaller images download faster, decode faster, and reduce LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) risk - without needing developers to manually run scripts or designers to export “web versions” every time.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Upload Images the Fast Way (Drag, Drop, Done)

Once optimisation is enabled, your normal upload flow becomes your performance workflow.

LeadCMS supports multi-file drag-and-drop uploads with clear feedback. This makes it easy to keep a project moving even when you have a lot of media to publish.

![Media upload dialog in LeadCMS](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/media-upload-dialog.avif)

<Callout type="tip">
  Practical tip: keep uploads organized by using the folder path (scope UID) for each page, post, or feature area. A tidy media library makes it easier to maintain performance over time.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Use the New Media Library Views to Stay Organized

Performance isn't only about speed today - it's also about staying fast as your site grows. The improved media grid/list views help teams keep control over what ships.

You can quickly scan:

- File types (to spot outdated formats)
- File sizes (to spot heavy assets)
- Usage (to avoid breaking content)

![Media library list view in LeadCMS](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/new-media-grid-view-with-size.avif)

<Callout type="info">
  A simple rule of thumb: if you see unexpectedly large files in a content area that affects LCP (hero images, above-the-fold visuals), optimise them immediately.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Verify the Results in the Preview and Details Tabs

LeadCMS makes optimisation visible. In the Media Preview dialog you can:

- Check the image visually (Preview tab)
- See size and dimensions (Details tab)
- Copy the URL for your content or front-end

![Media preview dialog (Preview tab)](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/media-preview-dialog-preview-tab.avif)

![Media preview dialog (Details tab)](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/media-preview-dialog-details-tab.avif)

<Callout type="info">
  The key Lighthouse benefit here is confidence: editors can confirm that an image is not only “the right picture”, but also the right **format, dimensions, and weight**.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Resize Images (Without Re-exporting in Photoshop)

Sometimes the best optimisation is simply serving the right dimensions. If your blog layout only renders images at \~1200px wide, uploading a 5000px image is wasted bytes.

LeadCMS includes a **Resize** tool directly in the media UI. It’s ideal for:

- Scaling down large screenshots
- Creating smaller variants for lightweight pages
- Fixing images that are “too big” for the design

![Resize dialog in LeadCMS](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/media-preview-dialog-resize-feature.avif)

This is one of the easiest ways to prevent common Lighthouse warnings like “Properly size images”.

## Step 6: Use One-Click Optimise for Existing Images

Optimisation isn't only for new uploads. If you have older images (or you change your preferred format/dimensions), LeadCMS lets you re-apply your current rules.

In practice, this helps when:

- You previously uploaded PNG/JPEG files and now want AVIF/WebP
- Your design has changed and you want stricter max dimensions
- You want to reduce the weight of LCP images on key pages

![Optimize and resize actions in LeadCMS](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/media-optimise-resize-reset.avif)

This matters because the fastest sites are maintained - not “optimised once”. LeadCMS lets you continuously improve performance without rebuilding your entire asset pipeline.

## Step 7: Reset an Image Back to the Original

Sometimes you need to undo a change. LeadCMS includes a **Reset** action that lets you revert an image back to its original uploaded file.

This is useful when:

- You optimised with the wrong settings and want to start over
- You resized too aggressively
- You want to restore the original format/quality before trying a different optimisation setup

## Step 8: Optimise/Reset an Entire Folder (Optional Subfolders)

When you update your optimisation rules (format, quality, or max dimensions), you may want to apply them consistently across a section of the site.

LeadCMS lets you **optimise** or **reset** all images within a folder, with the option to **include subfolders**.

![Folder optimise/reset actions in LeadCMS](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/optimize-and-reset-per-folder.avif)

Before running a folder action, you’ll see a confirmation step where you can decide whether to include nested folders.

![Folder optimisation confirmation dialog](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/per-folder-optimisation-confirmation.avif)

This is especially helpful for large sites where media is organized by page, feature, or campaign folders.

## What This Looks Like in a “100% Lighthouse” Workflow

A simple workflow that works well for most teams:

1. **Enable optimisation** globally (AVIF + max dimensions)
2. Upload images through the Media Library (drag-and-drop)
3. For anything used above the fold (hero/cover):
   - Verify size and dimensions in Details
   - Resize if needed
   - Optimise if the file looks too heavy
4. When settings change, **optimise a folder** (optionally including subfolders) to re-apply your latest rules
5. If anything goes wrong, use **Reset** to return an image (or a folder) back to the original
6. Keep an eye on the media list for “large” outliers over time

The result: faster pages, fewer performance regressions, and a CMS workflow that supports speed by default.

## Why This Matters (Beyond Lighthouse Scores)

A 100% Lighthouse score is a great goal, but the real wins are:

- Faster experience for mobile users
- Better SEO signals from performance and UX metrics
- Lower bandwidth and hosting costs
- Less time spent manually preparing images

LeadCMS helps you build super fast sites by combining **content management** and **media performance tooling** in one place - so performance becomes part of publishing, not a separate “cleanup step”.
