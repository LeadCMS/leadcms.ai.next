# LeadCMS Documentation

Welcome to the LeadCMS documentation!
Here you’ll find everything you need to build, run and extend your projects using **LeadCMS** - a free, open‑source headless CMS & CRM designed for modern, content‑first workflows.

## What makes LeadCMS unique?

LeadCMS combines the power of a **headless CMS** with the features of a full **CRM** in a single platform. You can:

- **Model content first.** Define your content types, fields and relationships before writing any code.
- **Deliver blazing‑fast sites.** Use any framework - Next.js, Gatsby, Astro and more - via our SDK and API.
- **Automate workflows with AI.** Generate and translate content or images using built‑in AI plugins.
- **Track and convert customers.** Manage leads, track interactions and automate communication within the same system.
- **Extend via plugins.** Choose from built‑in plugins for AI, email, reverse proxy and more, or develop your own.

Whether you’re a solo developer, an agency, startup, or an enterprise team, LeadCMS gives you a flexible foundation for content management, customer management and automation.

## Navigating the documentation

The documentation is organised around a developer’s journey. Each section guides you from initial setup to advanced topics:

- **Getting Started:** Install LeadCMS, run it locally and bootstrap your first project - including a Next.js quickstart.
- **Modeling:** Learn how to design content types, fields, media and internationalisation (i18n), and how to manage roles and drafts.
- **SDK & API:** Integrate your site using the LeadCMS SDK and REST/GraphQL APIs. Fetch content, handle routes & slugs and leverage the CLI.
- **Preview:** Set up live preview and draft mode. Run a preview server that watches for changes and supports hot reloads.
- **Deploy:** Explore deployment options - from static export to Docker images - and understand environment variables and secrets.
- **CI/CD:** Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions, build hooks and multi‑environment workflows for Vercel, Netlify and beyond.
- **Plugins:** Discover the plugin system, enable built‑in plugins and learn how to extend LeadCMS with your own modules.
- **Ops:** Manage backups, recovery, upgrades and monitoring to keep your instance healthy.
- **Reference:** Access detailed API, SDK and CLI references as well as configuration keys.

You can jump straight to a section or follow the journey sequentially. Links throughout the docs connect related topics.

## Architecture overview

LeadCMS uses a modern, enterprise‑grade technology stack:

- **Backend:** .NET and C# provide high performance and cross‑platform compatibility.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL stores content, CRM data and configuration with JSON support and full‑text search.
- **Deployment:** Docker containerisation ensures consistent setup across development and production.

This architecture gives you scalability, security and maintainability out of the box.

## Prerequisites

To get the most from these docs, you should be comfortable with:

- **Docker** and basic containerisation concepts.
- **REST APIs** and HTTP requests.
- **Git** for source control.
- **Command‑line** basics.

For plugin development or advanced customisation, knowledge of **C#** and **.NET** will be useful.
