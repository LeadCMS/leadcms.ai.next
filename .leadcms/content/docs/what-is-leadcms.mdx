import { LeadCMS } from '@leadcms/client'

const cms = new LeadCMS({
  apiKey: process.env.LEADCMS_API_KEY,
  projectId: process.env.LEADCMS_PROJECT_ID
})

// Fetch a single page
const page = await cms.pages.get('homepage')

// Fetch multiple articles
const articles = await cms.articles.list({
  limit: 10,
  filter: { status: 'published' }
})
```
