# LeadCMS Documentation

Welcome to the LeadCMS documentation!

## What is LeadCMS?

LeadCMS is an open-source, AI-powered CMS & CRM designed specifically for SaaS teams. You use it to manage content, track customer journeys, and automate sales processes. LeadCMS provides headless CMS capabilities for building fast websites, plus comprehensive CRM features for lead management.

It automatically handles complex backend operations like content versioning, customer tracking, and plugin orchestration. You can instead focus on building your product and growing your business.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger SaaS team, LeadCMS can help you build fast, scalable websites and automate your entire sales funnel.

## CMS and CRM in one box

LeadCMS uniquely combines two powerful systems:

- **Headless CMS**: Modern content management system, perfect for building fast websites with Next.js, Gatsby, and other frameworks.
- **CRM**: Customer relationship management built specifically for SaaS businesses, tracking the entire customer journey from first visit to conversion.

This integrated approach means you can manage both content and customers in one platform, with shared data and unified workflows.

## How to use the docs

The docs are organized into 2 main sections:

- **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)**: Step-by-step tutorials to help you deploy LeadCMS and learn the core features.
- **[Plugins](/docs/plugins)**: Comprehensive guide to available plugins and how to extend functionality.

## Architecture Overview

LeadCMS uses a modern, enterprise-grade technology stack:

- **Backend**: Built on .NET and C# for high performance and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage with JSON support and full-text search.
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for consistent deployment across environments.

This architecture ensures scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

Our documentation assumes some familiarity with modern web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:

- **Docker** and containerization concepts
- **REST APIs** and HTTP requests
- **Git** for version control
- **Command line** basics

If you're planning to extend LeadCMS with custom plugins, knowledge of **C#** and **.NET** will be helpful.
