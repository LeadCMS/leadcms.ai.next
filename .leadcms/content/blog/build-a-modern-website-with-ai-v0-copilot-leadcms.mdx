## Step 1: V0 Site Generation

Generate your initial website foundation using V0's AI-powered interface creation. This phase establishes the visual design and component structure.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Your Site Foundation with V0">

Start by crafting a detailed prompt that describes your website vision to V0. The key is being specific about functionality, branding, and structure while letting V0 handle the technical implementation.

**Example Prompt Used for Nuzzl:**

> "I need a new website for nuzzl.co.uk, the logo is attached. We should build a site using the logo colours. The website should make reference to the system we offer at www.tagpoint.co.uk, the odoo erp development and implementations, implementation and hosting services for leadcms.ai and we also provide outsourcing in the same way as www.duklas.com.
>
> Nuzzl is based in the south west of england in a city called Plymouth. Many years of experience developing and implementing systems. We have a strong product portfolio backed by teams in Denmark and Sri Lanka."

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Tip**: The final design was ready after just 3 refinement prompts. Start with a comprehensive initial prompt, then use follow-up prompts for specific adjustments rather than complete redesigns.
</Callout>

**V0 Generated Assets:**
- Complete Next.js 15 project structure with proper routing
- Responsive layout components (header, footer, navigation)
- Hero section with compelling call-to-action elements
- Service showcase cards with integrated icons
- Contact form components with validation
- Professional Tailwind CSS styling system
- Production-ready shadcn/ui component library integration

**Project Export Process:**
1. Review the generated design in V0's preview interface
2. Click "Export" button in the V0 interface
3. Select "Download as ZIP" for full project export
4. Extract the ZIP file to your development directory

**Reference**: [View the complete Nuzzl V0 project](https://v0.app/chat/nuzzl-website-os7yB65HnOp)

![V0 interface showing the generated Nuzzl website with prompt input, preview panel, and export options](/media/blog/build-a-modern-website-with-ai-v0-copilot-leadcms/v0-interface-nuzzl-generation.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Development Environment">

Set up your local development environment and verify that all V0-generated components work correctly before adding LeadCMS integration.

```bash
# Extract and navigate to project directory
unzip nuzzl-website.zip
cd nuzzl-website

# Install all project dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev
```

<Callout type="info">
**Environment Setup**: Open the project in VS Code to activate GitHub Copilot integration. Copilot will automatically start providing intelligent suggestions based on your project context.
</Callout>

At this stage, you should have a fully functional website running locally at `http://localhost:3000`. Verify that all components render correctly and the responsive design works across different screen sizes.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: LeadCMS Integration

Transform your V0-generated static site into a content-managed architecture by integrating the LeadCMS SDK and separating content from presentation.

<Callout type="info">
**Prerequisites**: This article assumes you have LeadCMS running locally or on a server. If you don't have LeadCMS set up yet, follow the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation/) first.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integrate LeadCMS SDK">

Transform your static V0-generated site into a dynamic, content-managed website by integrating the LeadCMS SDK. This step separates content from code, enabling non-technical team members to manage website content.

**Install the LeadCMS SDK:**

```bash
pnpm add -D @leadcms/sdk
```

**Configure Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your LeadCMS instance credentials:

```bash
# LeadCMS Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEADCMS_URL=https://admin.nuzzl.co.uk
LEADCMS_API_KEY=your-secret-api-key-here
LEADCMS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Best Practice">
Never expose API keys publicly. The `LEADCMS_API_KEY` should NOT have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix to keep it secure and only available server-side.
</Callout>

**Add LeadCMS Automation Scripts:**

Update your `package.json` to include automated content fetching:

Update your `package.json` scripts section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "fetch": "leadcms fetch",
    "prebuild": "leadcms fetch && leadcms generate-env",
    "predev": "pnpm run prebuild",
    "build": "next build",
    "dev": "next dev"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Automated Workflow">
The `prebuild` and `predev` scripts ensure content is automatically fetched before every build or development session, keeping your local content synchronized with the CMS.
</Callout>

![VS Code project structure showing .env file, package.json with LeadCMS scripts, and newly created .leadcms folder](/media/blog/build-a-modern-website-with-ai-v0-copilot-leadcms/project-structure-leadcms-integration.png)

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: AI-Enhanced Refactoring with Copilot

Use GitHub Copilot with our comprehensive instructions file to intelligently refactor your codebase and implement content separation patterns.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup AI-Enhanced Development with Copilot Instructions">

Download and use our comprehensive Copilot instructions file to enable context-aware AI assistance throughout your development process.

**The Copilot Instructions Strategy:**

Instead of explaining best practices in every prompt, use a **Copilot instructions file** that GitHub Copilot automatically reads and uses as context. This approach transforms your AI development workflow.

**Download the Production-Ready Instructions File:**

Rather than creating your own from scratch, download our battle-tested Copilot instructions that have been refined through real-world LeadCMS projects:

```bash
# Create the .github directory and download the instructions file
mkdir -p .github
curl -o .github/copilot-instructions.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeadCMS/leadcms.ai.next/refs/heads/develop/.github/copilot-instructions.md
```

**Benefits of Using Our Copilot Instructions:**

<Callout type="success" title="Essential Reading: Study the Instructions File">
**Before continuing, study the complete Copilot instructions file:** [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeadCMS/leadcms.ai.next/refs/heads/develop/.github/copilot-instructions.md)

This battle-tested file contains the architectural patterns and development workflows that make this entire approach possible. Understanding these principles is essential for successful implementation.
</Callout>

![GitHub Copilot in VS Code showing intelligent code suggestions for LeadCMS component creation with the instructions file context](/media/blog/build-a-modern-website-with-ai-v0-copilot-leadcms/copilot-suggestions-component-creation.png)

  </Step>
</Steps>

**The Architectural Challenge: From All-in-One to Separated Content**

V0 generates sites where content and markup are tightly coupled - headlines, descriptions, and text are hardcoded directly in React components. To make content manageable through LeadCMS, we need to separate these concerns:

```jsx
// ❌ V0 Pattern: Content mixed with markup
export function Hero() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Transform Your Business with AI</h1>
      <p>We provide cutting-edge AI solutions...</p>
      <Button>Get Started Today</Button>
    </section>
  )
}

// ✅ LeadCMS Pattern: Content separated from markup
export function Hero({ content }) {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>{content.title}</h1>
      <p>{content.description}</p>
      <Button href={content.ctaLink}>{content.ctaText}</Button>
    </section>
  )
}
```

With the instructions file providing context, here's the focused prompt used for the Nuzzl project to implement the content separation strategy:

<Callout type="note" title="Actual Production Prompt">
"We have a website created in V0, and I would like to integrate it with LeadCMS to pull all the content from it and edit it there. We already have a LeadCMS instance available at https://admin.nuzzl.co.uk.

We will be using LeadCMS SDK to pull the data from CMS. Your task is to restructure the current site which has content and markup mixed together into a new more structured form compatible with LeadCMS.

Important requirements:
1. We use pnpm as our package manager
2. All text content should be moved to MDX/JSON files in .leadcms/content/
3. No fallback content blocks in the code - if content doesn't exist in .leadcms/content/, the build should fail
4. All sections should be customizable in the CMS rather than hardcoded in components
5. Generate all MDX/JSON content files necessary to render the site as it currently appears

Please restructure the project accordingly, preserving the current site structure and pages while making all content editable in LeadCMS."
</Callout>

With the instructions file in place, Copilot instantly understands all the architectural patterns, content design principles, and development best practices without requiring detailed explanations in every prompt.

This context-aware approach enabled Copilot to:
- Analyze the existing V0 project structure
- Design appropriate content types and schemas
- Create structured MDX components
- Generate necessary content files with correct frontmatter

**AI-Generated Project Architecture:**

Copilot analyzed the existing V0 site structure and generated a content architecture. Here's what was created:

**Content Directory Structure:**

```txt
.leadcms/
  content/
    metadata.json       # Site-wide metadata and configuration
    header.json        # Navigation and branding elements
    footer.json        # Footer links and company information
    home.mdx           # Main landing page content
    privacy.mdx        # Privacy policy content
    terms.mdx          # Terms of service content
```

**Generated MDX Component Library:**

```txt
components/
  mdx/
    hero-section.tsx      # Dynamic hero sections with CTA integration
    service-grid.tsx      # Responsive service cards with icon support
    about-section.tsx     # Company information and team sections
    contact-section.tsx   # Contact forms with validation
    cta-section.tsx       # Call-to-action sections with analytics
```

![File explorer showing the generated .leadcms/content folder structure with MDX files and components/mdx directory](/media/blog/build-a-modern-website-with-ai-v0-copilot-leadcms/generated-content-structure.png)

**AI-Generated MDX Content Example:**

Here's a sample of the MDX content that Copilot generated, demonstrating the content-inside-tags approach and component usage:

```mdx
---
title: Nuzzl - Where Technology Meets Business Excellence
slug: home
type: landing
---

<HeroSection title="Where Technology Meets Business Excellence" subtitle="Expert software development and ERP implementation services.">
  <CTAs primaryText="Our Services" primaryHref="#services" secondaryText="Contact" secondaryHref="/contact" />
</HeroSection>

<CTASection title="Ready to Transform Your Business?" buttonText="Get Started" buttonHref="/contact" />
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Content Architecture Best Practice">
This example demonstrates the key principle: **use MDX frontmatter for metadata** (title, slug, type, etc.) and **MDX components for structured content**. This approach separates configuration from presentation while maintaining content editability.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI-Generated MDX Component Results">

As part of the content separation process, Copilot automatically generated reusable MDX components that maintain consistent styling and functionality across different pages.


**Generated Component Implementation:**

```typescript
interface HeroSectionProps {
  title: string
  subtitle: string
  children?: React.ReactNode
}

export function HeroSection({ title, subtitle, children }: HeroSectionProps) {
  return (
    <section className="hero">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{subtitle}</p>
      {children}
    </section>
  )
}

interface CTAsSectionProps {
  primaryText: string
  primaryHref: string
  secondaryText: string
  secondaryHref: string
}

export function CTAs({ primaryText, primaryHref, secondaryText, secondaryHref }: CTAsSectionProps) {
  return (
    <div className="cta-buttons">
      <Button href={primaryHref}>{primaryText}</Button>
      <Button variant="outline" href={secondaryHref}>{secondaryText}</Button>
    </div>
  )
}

interface CTASectionProps {
  title: string
  buttonText: string
  buttonHref: string
}

export function CTASection({ title, buttonText, buttonHref }: CTASectionProps) {
  return (
    <section className="cta-section">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <Button href={buttonHref}>{buttonText}</Button>
    </section>
  )
}
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Sync Content to LeadCMS

After Copilot has restructured your content locally, you need to sync all the generated MDX and JSON files back to your LeadCMS instance to enable content management through the admin interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Generated Content">

Before syncing to LeadCMS, review all locally generated content to ensure everything meets your requirements.

**Key Areas to Review:**

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Content Types"
    description="Verify that content types (home, landing, doc, etc.) match your site structure and naming conventions."
    icon="FolderTree"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Titles and Slugs"
    description="Check that page titles are clear and URL slugs follow your preferred format and SEO strategy."
    icon="Type"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Categories and Tags"
    description="Ensure categories and tags are consistent and follow your content organization strategy."
    icon="Tags"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Content Quality"
    description="Review all generated text content for accuracy, tone, and alignment with your brand voice."
    icon="CheckCircle"
  />
</FeatureGrid>

**Review Your Generated Files:**

```bash
# Explore your generated content structure
ls -la .leadcms/content/
tree .leadcms/content/  # If you have tree installed
```

Make any necessary adjustments to titles, slugs, categories, or content before proceeding to sync.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync Content to LeadCMS">

Use the LeadCMS SDK to synchronize all your local content files to your LeadCMS instance.

**Execute the Sync Command:**

```bash
# Sync all local content to LeadCMS
pnpm exec leadcms push
```

![Terminal showing the output of leadcms push command with content synchronization progress and success messages](/media/blog/build-a-modern-website-with-ai-v0-copilot-leadcms/leadcms-push-terminal-output.png)

**What This Command Does:**

1. **Content Type Management**: Reads content types from both CMS and local system, creating any missing content types automatically

2. **Content Matching Logic**:
   - **By ID**: If local content has an `id` that matches remote content, it's marked for update
   - **By Slug/Title**: If no ID match, tries to find content with the same slug or title for updating
   - **New Content**: If no matches found, creates new content records

3. **Smart Updates**:
   - Compares `updatedAt` timestamps between local and remote content
   - **Safe Update**: If timestamps match, proceeds with update
   - **Conflict Detection**: If timestamps differ, suggests running `leadcms pull` first to resolve conflicts

4. **Metadata Processing**:
   - Parses frontmatter from MDX files for metadata
   - Extracts content body from MDX and JSON files
   - Creates proper LeadCMS records with all attributes

<Callout type="warning" title="Handling Conflicts">
If you see conflict warnings during sync, resolve them safely:

```bash
# Pull latest changes from LeadCMS first
pnpm exec leadcms pull

# Resolve any conflicts in your local files
# Then push again
pnpm exec leadcms push

# Or override remote changes if you're certain (use carefully)
pnpm exec leadcms push --force
```
</Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit Updated Metadata">

After successful sync, LeadCMS will update your local files with additional metadata from the CMS.

**Expected Changes:**

Your local MDX files will now include additional frontmatter fields:

```yaml
---
id: 42
createdAt: '2025-10-29T10:30:00.000Z'
updatedAt: '2025-10-29T10:30:00.000Z'
title: 'Your Page Title'
slug: 'your-page-slug'
type: 'home'
# ... other existing fields
---
```

**Commit These Changes:**

```bash
# Stage all updated files
git add .leadcms/content/

# Commit the metadata updates
git commit -m "Add LeadCMS metadata to content files after sync"
```

<Callout type="success" title="Sync Complete">
🎉 **Content Successfully Synced!** Your content is now available in LeadCMS admin interface for easy editing by content managers.
</Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Content Editing Workflows">

With content synced to LeadCMS, you now have two powerful editing workflows available.

**For Developers - Local Editing:**

Continue editing content locally in VS Code with full AI assistance:

```bash
# Make changes to .leadcms/content/ files in VS Code
# Use Copilot for content suggestions and improvements
# Test changes locally with: pnpm run dev
# Sync changes back: pnpm exec leadcms push
```

**For Content Editors - LeadCMS Admin UI:**

Content editors can now manage content through the user-friendly LeadCMS admin interface:

- **No technical knowledge required** - Edit content through web forms
- **Real-time preview** - See changes as you type
- **Media management** - Upload and organize images and files
- **Content workflows** - Draft, review, and publish content

![LeadCMS admin interface showing content management dashboard with list of pages and editing interface](/media/blog/build-a-modern-website-with-ai-v0-copilot-leadcms/leadcms-admin-interface.png)

<Callout type="info" title="Content Editor Benefits">
Content editors don't need VS Code, Git, or technical knowledge. They can focus purely on content while developers handle the technical architecture.
</Callout>

**Build-Time Content Integration:**

Your build process automatically pulls the latest content from LeadCMS:

```bash
# Content is automatically fetched during builds
pnpm run build  # Pulls latest content from LeadCMS before building

# Or manually fetch latest content
pnpm exec leadcms pull
```

<Callout type="note" title="Preview Environments">
**Coming Soon**: Live preview servers can be configured so content editors can see changes instantly without site redeployment. We'll cover this advanced setup in a future article.
</Callout>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Local Development and Preview

With your content synced to LeadCMS and available for editing, it's time to run your AI-built website locally and see the complete workflow in action.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Local Development Server">

Run your website locally to preview the complete AI-generated site with LeadCMS content integration.

**Start the Development Server:**

```bash
# Ensure content is fetched and environment is ready
pnpm run fetch
