We're excited to announce LeadCMS, a free open source headless CMS platform that combines content management with integrated CRM in one powerful solution for modern developers.

## Why We Built LeadCMS

After working with countless development teams, agencies, and businesses, we noticed a common pattern: teams were juggling multiple expensive tools to manage their content, track customers, and automate their sales processes. This fragmentation led to:

- **Data silos** between marketing and sales teams
- **Inefficient workflows** requiring constant context switching
- **Integration headaches** connecting disparate systems
- **Higher costs** from maintaining multiple subscriptions

We knew there had to be a better way.

## The Best of Both Worlds

LeadCMS uniquely combines two powerful systems in one integrated platform:

### Free Open Source Headless CMS

Modern content management with AI-powered automation:

- **AI-powered content suggestions** and automated generation
- **Lightning-fast performance** with static site generation for Next.js, Gatsby, Astro
- **Framework agnostic** - works with any modern JavaScript framework
- **Git-based content versioning** to track changes over time
- **Multi-language support** out of the box

### Integrated CRM

Comprehensive customer relationship management for any business:

- **Customer journey tracking** from first visit to conversion
- **Lead scoring** and qualification automation
- **Pipeline management** with customizable stages
- **Email integration** for seamless communication
- **Analytics and reporting** to measure what matters most

## Built on Modern Technology

LeadCMS is built with enterprise-grade technologies:

- **Backend**: .NET and C# for high performance and reliability
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSON support and full-text search
- **Deployment**: Docker for consistent deployment anywhere
