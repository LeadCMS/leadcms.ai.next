<Callout type="warning" title="Getting a 'File Too Large' Error?">
  If LeadCMS is blocking your image upload because it exceeds the 500KB limit, you're in the right place. This guide shows you how to upload, resize, and optimize images directly in LeadCMS so you can stay under the limit without sacrificing quality.
</Callout>

As a content editor, you can directly impact your website's performance. While you might focus on crafting compelling copy and engaging layouts, there's one crucial detail that can dramatically affect your visitors' experience: **image file sizes**.

In LeadCMS, we enforce a **500 KB limit** for standard image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF). This isn't arbitrary - it's based on performance testing to help ensure your content loads quickly for all visitors. The good news: with the latest Media Library features, you can handle the full workflow (upload -> verify -> resize -> optimize) without leaving LeadCMS.

## Quick Fix: Upload and Optimize in LeadCMS (Fastest)

Need to upload your image immediately? Here are the fastest options using the built-in media tools:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Media Optimisation in Settings (1 minute)">
    1. Go to **Settings → Media**
    2. Confirm **Maximum File Size (KB)** matches your policy (for example, 500)
    3. Turn on **Auto-Optimise on Upload**
    4. Set **Maximum Dimensions** (for example, 1024×1024)
    5. Choose a target **Format** (AVIF is a strong default) and a quality level
    6. Save settings

  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Your Image (Drag, Drop, Done)">
    1. Open the **Media** Library
    2. Click **Upload** (or drag-and-drop files)
    3. Choose an optional subfolder to keep assets organized
    4. Upload your file(s)

    ![Media upload dialog in LeadCMS](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/media-upload-dialog.avif)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Size and Dimensions in Media Details">
    1. Click the uploaded image to open **Media Preview**
    2. Go to the **Details** tab
    3. Check **Current size** and **Dimensions**
    4. If it's still too large, use **Resize** and/or **Optimize** (next steps)

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why File Size Matters More Than You Think

### The Real Impact on Your Visitors

When someone visits your page on a mobile device over a 3G connection, every kilobyte counts:

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard title="Large Images (2-5 MB each)" description="Page loads in 15-30 seconds. Most visitors abandon your site before seeing your content." />

  <FeatureCard title="Optimized Images (300-500 KB each)" description="Page loads in 2-4 seconds. Visitors stay engaged and read your content." />
</FeatureGrid>

### Search Engine Rankings

**Search engines favor fast sites because user behavior improves dramatically with better speed.** When pages load quickly, users:

- Stay longer on the site (lower bounce rates)
- Click through more pages (higher engagement)
- Complete more actions (better conversion signals)
- Return more frequently (improved user loyalty)

These positive user behavior signals tell search engines your site provides value, leading to higher rankings.

### Mobile Experience

Over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices. Large images cause:

- **Slow loading** on cellular connections
- **Data overage charges** for users with limited plans
- **Battery drain** from processing large files
- **Poor user experience** leading to high bounce rates

## The Flexibility Advantage

You might wonder: "Why can't LeadCMS just handle this automatically?" Now it can.

LeadCMS supports both:

- **Automatic optimisation on upload** (set it once in Settings)
- **Manual optimisation** from the Media Preview tools (useful for exceptions)

This keeps editors in control while still making performance the default.

### Every Image is Different

Different types of images respond better to different optimization techniques:

- **AVIF format** typically delivers the smallest files with strong quality
- **WebP format** is also highly efficient and widely supported
- **Photographs** usually compress well at moderate quality settings
- **Graphics with transparency** may require careful choices depending on how they're used

### Your Creative Vision Matters

As a content editor, you understand your images better than any automated system:

- Which details are important to preserve
- What quality level maintains your brand standards
- Whether an image serves as decoration or critical information
- How the image fits within your overall content strategy

## The Designer vs Developer Dilemma (And Why You're the Solution)

If you've worked with development teams, you've probably seen this classic debate:

**Designer**: "This image looks terrible at 70% quality. Look at these compression artifacts around the text. Our brand standards require crisp, high-quality visuals."

**Developer**: "But it's 2.3 MB. The page takes 15 seconds to load on mobile. Nobody will wait that long to see your beautiful image."

Both are right - and both are missing the bigger picture.

### The Reality Check

Here's what we've learned from real-world testing: **a visitor who never sees your page can't appreciate your beautiful imagery**. The most perfectly crafted, pixel-perfect image is worthless if it causes visitors to abandon your site before it loads.

Consider this scenario:

- **Version A**: Stunning 3 MB hero image, loads in 25 seconds on 3G
- **Version B**: Well-optimized 400 KB hero image, loads in 3 seconds on 3G

Version A might win in a side-by-side quality comparison, but Version B wins where it matters most: **real user engagement**.

### The Sweet Spot: 500 KB and Under

Through extensive testing across different networks and devices, we've found that **images under 500 KB consistently perform well** on most connections.

<Callout type="info" title="Why 500 KB Works">
  This isn't an arbitrary number. It's based on real-world network performance data. A 500 KB image typically loads quickly on standard mobile connections, keeping visitors engaged while preserving visual quality.
</Callout>

### Finding Your Golden Middle

The art of image optimization isn't about choosing between "beautiful" and "functional" - it's about finding the **golden middle** where:

- ✅ **Quality is good enough** that visitors trust your brand
- ✅ **File size is small enough** that visitors actually see your content
- ✅ **Loading speed is fast enough** that visitors stay engaged

### Practical Guidelines for the Golden Middle

- **Start with 500 KB as your ceiling**, not your floor
- **Smaller is always better** - aim for 300-400 KB when possible
- **Resize to the dimensions you actually need**
- **Verify results in Media Details** before using the image in important sections

## Practical Optimization Guidelines

### Choose the Right Format

<Callout type="info" title="Format Decision Tree (Best to Worst Compression)">
  - **AVIF**: Best compression and great quality for most web images
  - **WebP**: Excellent compression and wide modern browser support
  - **JPEG**: Use when you specifically need it for compatibility or workflows
  - **PNG**: Use for transparency or when lossless quality is required
</Callout>

### Quality Settings That Work

**For most content images:**

- **Hero images, product photos**: 80-90% quality
- **Blog post images, thumbnails**: 70-80% quality
- **Background images, decorative elements**: 60-70% quality

### Size Recommendations

Before uploading (or after upload via Resize), keep dimensions aligned with how the image will display:

- Blog post images: 800-1200px wide
- Thumbnails: 300-400px wide
- Hero images: 1200-1600px wide
- Background images: 1200-1920px wide

Don't ship a 4000px wide image if it will display at 800px.

## Step-by-Step Optimization Workflow

### Step 1: Upload and Keep Media Organized

Use the Media Library to upload images and keep folders tidy. The list view makes it easier to spot large outliers and keep performance consistent as the site grows.

### Step 2: Verify in Details (Before You Publish)

Open the media item and review it in the **Details** tab:

- Current size (what your site will serve)
- Original size (what was uploaded)
- Dimensions
- URL for use in your content/front-end

![Media preview dialog (Details tab)](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/media-preview-dialog-details-tab.avif)

### Step 3: Resize in LeadCMS (No Re-export Needed)

If the image is too large in dimensions, resize it directly in the Media Preview tools. Resizing is often the fastest way to reduce file size.

![Resize dialog in LeadCMS](/media/blog/100-lighthouse-score-with-image-optimization/media-preview-dialog-resize-feature.avif)

### Step 4: Optimize Existing Images (One-Click)

If you have older images, or you changed your preferred format/quality/dimensions in settings, you can apply your current optimisation rules to existing media.

### Step 5: Optimize or Reset a Whole Folder (Optional)

For large sites, you can apply optimisation across a folder (and optionally include subfolders). This helps you apply new settings across a section of the site.

## The Bottom Line

A well-optimized image that loads quickly will consistently outperform a perfect image that causes visitors to abandon your page. In LeadCMS, the 500 KB limit isn't a restriction - it's a performance guardrail supported by a media workflow that lets you upload, verify, resize, and optimize images right where you publish.

<Callout type="success" title="Success!">
  Following this guide helps eliminate "file too large" errors and keeps your website consistently fast. Upload images through the Media Library, verify in Details, then resize/optimize as needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does LeadCMS have a 500KB file size limit?

The 500KB limit is based on performance testing. Images under this size are much less likely to slow down mobile users and hurt key metrics like LCP.

### Will compressing my images make them look bad?

Not if you verify the output. With LeadCMS, you can check the result and confirm the file size and dimensions before using an image in content.

### What's the difference between JPEG, PNG, WebP, and AVIF?

- **JPEG**: Common for photos; no transparency
- **PNG**: Best for transparency and lossless graphics; often larger files
- **WebP**: Modern, smaller files with good quality; widely supported
- **AVIF**: Newer format with excellent compression and quality

### Can I increase the file size limit in LeadCMS?

While it may be possible depending on your setup, increasing the limit often leads to performance regressions over time. A better approach is to use Media optimisation settings and resize/optimise within the Media Library.

### What if my image is still too large after optimization?

Try these steps in order:

1. Resize to smaller dimensions (match the design's display size)
2. Use a more efficient format (AVIF or WebP)
3. Lower the quality setting slightly
4. Re-check the result in Media Details

### How do I optimize images for retina displays?

Upload images at up to 2× the display size for sharpness, then use LeadCMS optimisation and resizing to keep file sizes low. Always verify the final **Current size** in Details.

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Keep your Media settings consistent (format, max dimensions, quality). When you change them, use folder optimisation to apply the new rules across a section of the site.
