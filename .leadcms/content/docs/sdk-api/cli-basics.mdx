# CLI Basics

The `leadcms` command‑line interface provides a set of tools to initialise your project, synchronise content, generate deployment templates and more.  All commands can be run with `npx leadcms <command>` if the SDK is installed locally or globally.  Use `--help` on any command to see its options.

## Core commands

- **`init`** – Interactive setup wizard.  Connects to your LeadCMS instance, detects languages, configures directories and creates a `.env` file.  See **SDK Setup** for details.
- **`login`** – Authenticates the CLI for write access.  Opens a browser for device authentication (v1.2.88+) or guides you through manual token extraction on older versions.  Stores the API key in your `.env` file.
- **`pull`** – Downloads all content, media and comments from LeadCMS into your local directories.  Uses incremental sync tokens to transfer only changed items on subsequent runs.  See **Pull Content** for more information.
- **`pull-content`** – Downloads only content files (MDX/JSON) without media or comments.  Useful when you want to refresh text and metadata but not assets.
- **`pull-media`** – Downloads only media files into your configured media directory.  Run this after updating images in the CMS.
- **`pull-comments`** – Downloads only comments.  Use when you have user feedback but no content changes.
- **`status`** – Shows the difference between your local content and the remote CMS.  It lists new, modified, renamed, type‑changed and conflicted files without making changes.  See **Status** for details.
- **`push`** – Synchronises your local content with LeadCMS.  Detects new files, updates and renames, and prompts for confirmation before applying changes.  Supports creating missing content types interactively.  See **Push Content** for details.
- **`watch`** – Watches your local files and pulls remote updates on the fly.  Use this to develop a live preview server that reflects changes in both directions.  See the [Preview Setup](/docs/preview/setup/) and [Deploy](/docs/deploy/static-export/) guides for configuration.
- **`docker`** – Generates Docker files and templates for deploying your static site and preview environment.  Produces production and preview Dockerfiles, nginx configuration and helper scripts.
- **`version`**/`-v`/`--version` – Displays the installed SDK version.
- **`help`** – Shows general help or command‑specific usage information.

Run any command with `--help` to see its options.  For example:

```bash
npx leadcms push --help
```

Outputs detailed descriptions of parameters such as `--dry-run`, `--force`, `--slug`, `--id`, and `--preview`.

## Workflow overview

In most projects your CLI workflow follows this pattern:

1. **Initialise** – Run `npx leadcms init` once per project to create a `.env` file and optional config file.
2. **Authenticate** – Run `npx leadcms login` if you need to push changes back to the CMS.
3. **Pull** – Use `npx leadcms pull` (or `pull-content`, `pull-media`, `pull-comments`) to populate and keep your local files in sync.
4. **Work offline** – Edit MDX/JSON files, add new content, update slugs and structure using your editor.
5. **Check status** – Run `npx leadcms status` to see what will change and resolve any conflicts.
6. **Push** – Run `npx leadcms push` to apply your local updates to LeadCMS.  Use `--dry-run` or `--force` options as needed.

Additional commands like `watch` and `docker` support previewing changes in real time and creating deployment artefacts.  See the [Preview Setup](/docs/preview/setup/) and [deployment guides](/docs/deploy/static-export/) for more details.
