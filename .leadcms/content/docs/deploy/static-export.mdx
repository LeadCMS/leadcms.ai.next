# Static Export

Most LeadCMS‑powered sites use static site generation to deliver content quickly and securely.
With static export, your pages are pre‑rendered at build time and served as simple HTML and assets from any hosting provider.
Although LeadCMS can drive a full server‑rendered application, this guide focuses on the most common pattern: exporting your site as static files.

## Overview

Static site generation (SSG) lets you build your site once and serve it anywhere – a CDN, object storage or even a simple file server.
LeadCMS works seamlessly with modern frameworks like Next.js, Astro and Gatsby. When using Next.js, the `output: 'export'` option generates a static build containing HTML files and assets for each route.

Key advantages of static export:

* **Performance & security:** Pages are served as pure HTML and assets, with no server runtime or database at request time.
* **Portability:** Host your site on any platform that can serve files (e.g. Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Azure Static Web Apps).
* **Predictability:** Builds are reproducible; your site does not depend on runtime environment configuration other than environment variables injected at deploy time.

## Building a static export with Next.js

To generate a static export you typically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable static export in Next.js">
    In your `next.config.js`, set the `output` property to `'export'` and enable trailing slashes if desired:

    ```js
    // next.config.js
    const nextConfig = {
      output: 'export',
      trailingSlash: true, // Optional: add '/' to all URLs for static hosting
    }
    module.exports = nextConfig
    ```

    The `trailingSlash` option ensures that URLs like `/about` are served from `/about/index.html` instead of `/about.html`. Some static hosts require one or the other; adjust based on your hosting platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the build and export">
    Build and export your site:

    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    pnpm run export
    ```

    After exporting, the contents of the `out/` directory are ready to deploy. The LeadCMS SDK ensures that any content linked to your project is pulled before the build.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test locally">
    Serve the static build locally to verify everything works:

    ```bash
    npx serve out
    ```

    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port displayed) and click through your pages. Check that links, images and 404 fallbacks behave correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to your host">
    Deploy the contents of `out/` to your chosen hosting provider.
    For example:

    - **Vercel**: Push the `out/` directory to a Git repository and configure Vercel for static deployment.
    - **Netlify**: Set the `publish` directory to `out/` and choose a static build.
    - **S3/CloudFront**: Upload the files in `out/` to an S3 bucket and configure CloudFront (ensure 404 responses redirect to `/404.html`).

    Refer to your hosting provider’s documentation for specifics. The key point is that no server runtime is required – only static files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Handling 404 pages

Static exports require explicit handling of missing pages. In Next.js, you create a `404.tsx` page in your `pages` or `app` directory. When you export, Next.js generates a `404.html` file that your host can serve when a URL is not found.
Ensure your hosting platform is configured to use `404.html` for unknown routes; on some platforms you may need to set up custom error page rules.

## Considerations for other frameworks

While this guide focuses on Next.js, the principles apply to any SSG framework:

* **Astro/Gatsby/SvelteKit** – Use their respective static export commands to generate files.
* **Trailing slashes** – Many frameworks support trailing slash settings; choose based on your host’s requirements.
* **Routes & 404** – Ensure a 404 page is included and your server is configured to serve it.

## Limitations

Static export works well for content‑heavy sites. However, certain dynamic features (authentication, personalised dashboards, real‑time data) may require a server. For those scenarios you can still use LeadCMS with a server‑rendered or hybrid framework, but that is outside the scope of this documentation.
