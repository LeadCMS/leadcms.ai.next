We're excited to announce LeadCMS, an open-source platform that combines the best of content management and customer relationship management in one powerful solution designed specifically for SaaS teams.

## Why We Built LeadCMS

After working with countless SaaS companies, we noticed a common pattern: teams were juggling multiple tools to manage their content, track customers, and automate their sales processes. This fragmentation led to:

- **Data silos** between marketing and sales teams
- **Inefficient workflows** requiring constant context switching
- **Integration headaches** connecting disparate systems
- **Higher costs** from maintaining multiple subscriptions

We knew there had to be a better way.

## The Best of Both Worlds

LeadCMS uniquely combines two powerful systems in one integrated platform:

### Headless CMS

Modern content management designed for speed and flexibility:

- **Fast performance** with static site generation support
- **Framework agnostic** - works with Next.js, Gatsby, and more
- **Content versioning** to track changes over time
- **Multi-language support** out of the box
- **Flexible content modeling** for any use case

### Comprehensive CRM

Customer relationship management built for SaaS:

- **Customer journey tracking** from first visit to conversion
- **Lead scoring** and qualification automation
- **Pipeline management** with customizable stages
- **Email integration** for seamless communication
- **Analytics and reporting** to measure what matters

## Built on Modern Technology

LeadCMS is built with enterprise-grade technologies:

- **Backend**: .NET and C# for high performance and reliability
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSON support and full-text search
- **Deployment**: Docker for consistent deployment anywhere
- **API-first**: RESTful API for complete flexibility

## Open Source and Extensible

We believe in the power of open source. LeadCMS is:

- **MIT Licensed** - use it for any project
- **Plugin architecture** - extend functionality with C# plugins
- **Active community** - join us on GitHub
- **Professional support** available for enterprise needs
