# Status

Before pushing your local changes back to LeadCMS, it's important to understand what will be created, updated or conflicted.  The `status` command provides a dry‑run view of the synchronisation state.  It compares your local MDX/JSON files with the remote CMS and categorises the results without making any changes.

## Running the command

To view the overall status of your project, run:

```bash
npx leadcms status
```

This reads all local content files and fetches the latest remote content.  The output is grouped into sections similar to `git status`:

- **New file** – Local files that do not exist in LeadCMS.  These will be created when you push.
- **Modified** – Local files with changes compared to the remote version.  These will be updated on push.
- **Renamed** – Local files whose slug has changed since the last push.  The remote content will be renamed accordingly.
- **Type change** – Local files whose `type` frontmatter value has changed.  The remote content will be updated to the new type.
- **Conflict** – Remote content that has been updated after your last pull (e.g. someone edited the same content in the CMS).  Conflicts must be resolved before pushing unless you use `--force`.

If the command outputs **No changes detected**, your local repository is in sync with LeadCMS.

## Filtering the status

You can check the status for a single piece of content by specifying an ID or slug.  This is useful when you only want to sync a particular file:

```bash
# Check status for a content item by slug
npx leadcms status --slug about-us

# Check status for a content item by ID
npx leadcms status --id 42
```

When filtering, the command shows a detailed diff preview for the targeted file.

<Callout type="warning" title="Conflicts and updates">
If a conflict is reported, run `npx leadcms pull` to retrieve the latest changes from LeadCMS, resolve any merge issues in your local files and then run `npx leadcms push` again.  You can override conflicts with `--force`, but be aware that this will overwrite remote changes.
</Callout>

## Detailed previews

You can display a diff of the content changes by adding the `--preview` flag:

```bash
npx leadcms status --preview
```

This shows a line‑by‑line comparison of your local file against the remote version for each modified, renamed or type‑changed item.  Use this to review changes before deciding to push.

## Best practices

- **Run status before every push.**  Checking status ensures you understand what will happen when you push and helps you avoid unexpected changes.
- **Pull first.**  Always run `npx leadcms pull` before `status` to ensure your local repository is up to date.  This reduces the chance of conflicts.
- **Resolve conflicts locally.**  When conflicts are reported, merge the changes manually in your editor.  Only use `--force` if you are certain you want to override remote updates.
- **Use filters for targeted updates.**  If you are working on a single page or post, filter by slug or ID to see exactly what will change.

The `status` command is a lightweight way to audit your content changes and maintain a clean, conflict‑free workflow.
