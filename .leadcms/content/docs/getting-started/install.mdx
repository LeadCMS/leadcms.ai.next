# Install

This guide shows you how to install and set up LeadCMS using **Docker Compose**. Follow these steps to get a local instance running quickly.

## System requirements

Before installing LeadCMS, ensure your machine meets these minimum requirements:

- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or higher
- **Docker Compose**: Version 2.10 or higher
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB (8 GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 10 GB free disk space (for development)
- **CPU**: 2 cores minimum
- **OS**: Linux, macOS or Windows

These requirements cover running the LeadCMS core application and its default PostgreSQL database in containers. No additional services like Elasticsearch are required for a basic installation.

## Quick start

Get LeadCMS running in minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the deployment repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LeadCMS/leadcms.deploy.git
    cd leadcms.deploy
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate environment variables">
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS
    chmod +x generate-env.sh
    ./generate-env.sh

    # Windows PowerShell
    .\generate-env.ps1
    ```
    This script reads `.env.sample`, generates secure secrets and writes a new `.env` file. If a `.env` file already exists, you’ll be asked before overwriting it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the stack with Docker Compose">
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

After the last step, your LeadCMS instance will be running at `http://localhost:8080`. The Docker Compose stack includes:

- **LeadCMS Core** – the .NET API and admin UI
- **PostgreSQL** – the primary database (no external setup required)

## Environment configuration

The generated `.env` file contains all configuration options. Review and customise these settings as needed:

### Email settings

```bash
# Email configuration for notifications
EMAIL__USERNAME=your-smtp-username
EMAIL__PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
EMAIL__SERVER=smtp.your-provider.com
EMAIL__PORT=587
EMAIL__USESSL=true
```

### Supported languages

```bash
# Configure supported languages
SUPPORTEDLANGUAGES__0=en
SUPPORTEDLANGUAGES__1=de
SUPPORTEDLANGUAGES__2=fr
# Add more languages by incrementing the index
```

### CORS origins

```bash
# Allow your frontend origins
CORS__ALLOWEDORIGINS__0=http://localhost:3000
CORS__ALLOWEDORIGINS__1=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Default admin user

```bash
# Default admin credentials – change these immediately
DEFAULTUSERS__0__USERNAME=admin
DEFAULTUSERS__0__EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com
DEFAULTUSERS__0__PASSWORD=SecurePassword123
```

<Callout type="danger" title="Security warning">
Always change the default admin credentials before using your instance in production. While credentials are stored securely in the `.env` file, you should set strong, unique values.
</Callout>

## Verifying your installation

After the containers start, verify everything is running correctly:

### Check running services

```bash
# List containers and their status
docker compose ps

# View LeadCMS logs
docker compose logs leadcms
```

### Access LeadCMS
1. **Admin interface** – open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and log in with the default admin credentials (from the `.env` file).
2. **API documentation** – visit `http://localhost:8080/swagger` to see the automatically generated Swagger UI.

### Test the API

```bash
# Retrieve the API version
curl http://localhost:8080/api/version
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their resolutions:

### Port already in use

If port 8080 is occupied:

```bash
# Find which process is using port 8080
lsof -i :8080

# Change the external port by editing docker-compose.yml
services:
  leadcms:
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
```

### Database connection issues

If LeadCMS cannot connect to PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker compose logs postgres

# Recreate the database (this will delete all data)
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

## Development vs production

<Callout type="warning" title="Development setup">
The provided Docker Compose configuration is intended for development, evaluation and local use. For production deployments, see our **Deploy** documentation for guidance on using managed databases, setting up SSL, backups, monitoring, and high‑availability architectures.
